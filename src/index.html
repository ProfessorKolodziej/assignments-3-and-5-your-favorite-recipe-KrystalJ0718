		<h2>What is Folded Kimbap?</h2>
		<p>The Folded Kimbap hack is a smart and quick way to have kimbap without going through the trouble of rolling it.
		</p>
		<p>The Korean tortilla hack was inspired by the viral tortilla hack on social media, where people would make a
			slit into a tortilla and place filling ingredients in each corner and fold to enjoy.</p>
		<p>The <a href="https://christieathome.com/blog/korean/">Korean</a> version of this hack uses Korean ingredients
			so you can enjoy a regular kimbap more easily. Then years later, the Korean drama "Extraordinary Attorney Woo"
			featured this hack and made it even more viral!</p>
		<p>My version features tuna mayo, kimchi, egg with leftover cooked rice and it really hits the spot! It's also a
			great meal to make when I am too lazy to make kimbap!</p>
		<p>You can also use different ingredients such as spam, fried tofu, perilla leaves, fish cake, yellow daikon
			radish, baby spinach, crab meat and more!</p>

		<h2>Expert Tips</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Work quickly and prepare ingredients before filling.</strong> The warm rice and egg softens the
				roasted seaweed so have your components ready to fill.</li>
			<li><strong>Fry the egg and shape it into a square so it fits the quandrant.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Place your seaweed sheet rough side up.</strong> This allows for the toppings, especially that rice
				to stick to your sheet.</li>
			<li><strong>Don't overfill the kimbap or the filling will fall out.</strong> I know it's tempting to fill that
				kimbap to your heart's desire to either use up the fillings or satiate that belly but if you do, it'll be
				very difficult to fold your kimbap neatly. So just a thin layer of each topping will do.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Storage</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Gimbap is best enjoyed fresh but leftovers</strong> will last up to 24 hours stored in an airtight
				container at room temperature.</li>
			<li><strong>Freezer friendly?</strong> Unfortunately I don't recommend freezing folded kimbap as the rice will
				turn hard.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Pairing Suggestions</h2>
		<p>Folded kimbap serves well with other Korean side dishes like kimchi, <a

		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<h3>Can I use other fillings?</h3>
		<p>Yes, feel free to sub the tuna mayo mixture with pan fried spam and the kimchi with cooked spinach sautéed with
			sesame oil and a bit of salt.</p>
		<h3>Is Kimbap eaten hot or cold?</h3>
		<p>Kimbap should be eaten fresh at room temperature or warm.</p>
		<h3>How long can you keep kimbap?</h3>
		<p>It should be consumed immediately or within 24 hours and no longer because rice is a breeding ground for
			bacteria.</p>
		<h3>What is the difference between sushi and kimbap?</h3>
		<p>Sushi originates from Japan and is a rice seaweed wrapped roll containing mostly raw and sometimes cooked
			ingredients. On the other hand, kimbap comes from Korea and contains mostly cooked ingredients. Certainly, both
			are very delicious!</p>
